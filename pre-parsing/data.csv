Assume standard gravity to be 10 m/s^2.4: Bonus Answer: Answer: 25 seconds. 
Since Fthrust = Gstandard×Isp×R, where
	Fthrust = instantaneous thrust of the engine (in newtons)
	Gstandard = standard gravity (usually 9.81 m/s^2, but for simplicity we round to 10)
	Isp = specific impulse of the engine in seconds
